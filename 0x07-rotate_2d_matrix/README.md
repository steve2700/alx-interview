## Introduction

Welcome to the `0x07-rotate_2d_matrix` project! In this project, we tackle the problem of rotating a given n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The goal is to implement an efficient in-place rotation algorithm.

## Problem Statement

Given an n x n 2D matrix, the task is to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation must be performed in-place, and the original matrix should be modified accordingly.

### Example:

**Input:**
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9]]  

**Output:**
[[7, 4, 1],
[8, 5, 2],
[9, 6, 3]]



## Whiteboarding Session

### Understanding the Problem:

1. **What is a 2D Matrix?**
   - A 2D matrix is a two-dimensional array with rows and columns.
   - It is commonly used to represent grids or tables of data.

2. **Problem Statement:**
   - Rotate a given n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
   - The rotation should be done in-place.

### Whiteboarding Session Steps:

1. **Clarify Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Input: 2D matrix (n x n)
   - Output: None (in-place rotation)

2. **Discuss Example:**
   - Example Matrix:
     ```
     [[1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]]
     ```
   - Expected Output after rotation:
     ```
     [[7, 4, 1],
      [8, 5, 2],
      [9, 6, 3]]
     ```

3. **Outline Steps:**
   - Visualize the rotation operation:
     ```
     [1, 2, 3]        [7, 4, 1]
     [4, 5, 6]   ==>  [8, 5, 2]
     [7, 8, 9]        [9, 6, 3]
     ```
   - Identify a pattern in the indices for the rotation.

4. **Plan Algorithm:**
   - Iterate through each layer of the matrix from outer to inner.
   - For each layer, rotate the elements in a cyclic manner.

5. **Discuss Complexity:**
   - Analyze the time and space complexity of the proposed algorithm.

6. **Write Pseudocode:**
   - Write down a high-level pseudocode for the rotation algorithm.

7. **Discuss Edge Cases:**
   - Consider edge cases such as an empty matrix or matrices with different dimensions.

8. **Implement the Code:**
   - Begin translating the pseudocode into actual Python code.
   - Follow the given requirements and constraints.

9. **Test the Implementation:**
   - Use the provided example and additional test cases to validate the correctness of the solution.

10. **Discuss Improvements:**
   - Discuss any potential optimizations or alternative approaches.

## Algorithm Explanation

The rotation algorithm follows a layer-by-layer approach. It iterates through each layer of the matrix, rotating the elements in a cyclic manner. The key steps include identifying the indices for rotation and performing the in-place rotation.

## Code Implementation

The code is implemented in Python and follows the provided requirements and constraints. It adheres to the pycodestyle style (version 2.8.0) and does not import any modules. All modules and functions are documented, and the code is executable.

## Testing

The code is tested using the provided example and additional test cases to ensure its correctness. Test cases cover scenarios such as empty matrices and matrices with different dimensions.
